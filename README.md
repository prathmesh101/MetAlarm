# MetAlarm
You’ve scheduled a busy weekend to try and catch up on schoolwork. 
Your plan goes something like this: 
Wake up at 8:00am Drive to campus at 8:30am 
Start homework for math class at 9:00am 
Start reviewing for computer science exam at 11:00am 
Lunch at 12:00pm 
Start programming project at 1:00pm 
Start reading assignment for GE class at 3:30pm … and so on 
Since you have an Android phone, you use the Clock app the night before to set alarms with reminder labels for each event. 
As usual, Murphy’s law rears its ugly head. 
There’s an accident on the 57. 
Your first alarm goes off while you’re stuck on the freeway, and you don’t make it to campus until 9:40. 
You pick up your phone and sigh; now what? You can’t stick with your schedule, because that math homework really is going to take two hours.
Should you go update all the alarms? 
Reschedule the 11:00am alarm for 11:40am, the 12:00pm alarm for 12:40pm, the 1:00pm alarm for 1:40pm. 
Maybe just throw in the towel and cancel them all? 
The problem is that you may have a plan, but it doesn’t really start until you arrive on campus.
